//! Pipeline stages that consume the Apple Intelligence
//! Foundation Models bridge.
//!
//! Each stage reads a cached transcript out of `ai_cache`,
//! builds a stage-specific prompt, calls
//! [`ab_foundation_models::complete`], parses the JSON the
//! model returns, and promotes the result into the library DB
//! (a column on `books`, a row in `book_tags`, a row in
//! `characters`, etc.).
//!
//! Shipped stages:
//!
//! - [`ExtractDnaTagsStage`] — `#`-prefixed thematic tags +
//!   `!`-prefixed spoiler tags into `book_tags`.
//! - [`ExtractSummaryStage`] — spoiler-free book summary into
//!   `books.summary_spoiler_free` + `_lang`.
//! - [`ExtractSeriesSummaryStage`] — spoiler-free series synopsis
//!   into `series.summary` + `_lang` (regenerated when a book
//!   joins a series or member-book summaries change).
//! - [`ExtractStoryArcStage`] — 5-7 narrative beats into
//!   `books.story_arc_json` (per ADR-0022 per-book content
//!   extractor template).
//! - [`ExtractCharactersStage`] — up to 12 characters per book
//!   into the `characters` table, with `is_pov` + 6 optional
//!   trait fields (species / condition / occupation / age /
//!   gender / affiliation). Migration 008 adds the trait
//!   columns; ADR-0022 § "Character trait taxonomy" is the
//!   source of truth for what each field carries.
//! - [`ExtractSettingStage`] — one-paragraph setting summary
//!   into `books.setting` + 10-category `$`-prefixed tags into
//!   `book_tags`. Migration 009 adds the paragraph columns;
//!   ADR-0021 + ADR-0022 codify the prefix class and the
//!   `$world` ↔ `$location` boundary the prompt enforces.
//!
//! All extractors follow the same pattern: idempotent re-runs
//! keyed by `LlmTunables.extractor_version` stamped on the
//! `ai_cache` row; user-fixable Foundation-Models failures
//! (Apple Intelligence disabled, device not eligible, model
//! not ready) propagate as `Err` so `aborg doctor llm` can
//! surface a fix-it, not as silent skips. The newer ones
//! (summary, future arc / characters) use
//! [`ab_foundation_models::complete_structured`] with a
//! `DynamicGenerationSchema` so the model can't emit
//! off-schema tokens; the DNA stage was retrofitted to the
//! same pattern in slice C5.7.d.
