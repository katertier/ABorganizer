//! Two-pass embedded-tag writer (ADR-0028).
//!
//! The pipeline produces metadata on two distinct timescales:
//!
//! 1. **5-minute DNA tags** — `tag-read` + `identity-resolve` +
//!    `extract-dna-tags`. Visible to the user within minutes of
//!    import.
//! 2. **Long-running AI outputs** — `extract-summary-spoiler-free`,
//!    `extract-story-arc`, `extract-characters`, `extract-setting`,
//!    `consensus`, future franchise / spoiler-free description.
//!    Accumulate over minutes-to-hours.
//!
//! Writing every tag only at the end of the pipeline leaves the
//! user staring at empty / stale tags during the AI window.
//! Writing every field on every change races user edits made via
//! the web UI. The decision (ADR-0028): two distinct stages, with
//! the late stage gated by `book_field_provenance.source !=
//! 'user_edit'` per-field.
//!
//! ## Scope of this slice
//!
//! Scaffolding only. The two `Stage` impls
//! ([`TagWriteEarlyStage`] / [`TagWriteFinalStage`]) ship as
//! `Skipped` skeletons — they exist so [`Stage::requires`] graphs
//! that name `tag-write-early` / `tag-write-final` upstream can
//! reference the live `StageId` constants. The `lofty`-based
//! file-write integration, the on-disk-match dedup, the m4b /
//! mp3 / flac per-format dispatcher, and the cover-art write path
//! land in follow-up slices.
//!
//! What ships here:
//!
//! - [`winners`] — the `SELECT` that pulls every winning row from
//!   `book_field_provenance` for one book. Used by both stages.
//! - [`USER_EDIT_SOURCE`] + [`skip_for_final_pass`] — the
//!   convention string + a tiny predicate that
//!   [`TagWriteFinalStage`] consults per-field. The string lives
//!   in one place so the eventual `record_user_edit()` helper in
//!   `ab-api` and the future typed `Source` enum (BACKLOG.md)
//!   stay in sync.
//! - [`stage::TagWriteEarlyStage`] / [`stage::TagWriteFinalStage`]
//!   — the two Stage impls. `name()`, `requires()`, and the
//!   typed `STAGE_ID` constants are real; `run()` is a no-op.
//!
//! Not registered in `aborg-daemon`'s pipeline registry yet —
//! per the slice cadence, skeletons stay invisible to operators
//! until they actually do work.
